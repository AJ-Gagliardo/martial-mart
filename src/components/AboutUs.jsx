        If you liked the real gi (from the carousel photos) the company that
        sells them is Primit, you can check their <a>website,</a> or their
        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/primit.co.kr/"> instagram</a>

        The first model on the carousel is my friend, credits to her
        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/seolhyeonah/">

        The guy is another primit model that I have no idea where to find him,
